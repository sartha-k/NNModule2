# Neural Network with nn.Sequential — PyTorch

A hands-on implementation of a multi-layer binary classification neural network using `nn.Sequential` inside `nn.Module`.

---

## What This Notebook Covers

- Building a multi-layer network using `nn.Sequential`
- Understanding the difference between explicit layers vs `nn.Sequential`
- Using `nn.ReLU` as a hidden layer activation function
- Accessing weights and biases of specific layers by index
- Visualizing model architecture using `torchinfo`

## Model Architecture

```
Input (batch_size, 5)
        ↓
Linear Layer 1 → (batch_size, 3)
        ↓
ReLU Activation → (batch_size, 3)
        ↓
Linear Layer 2 → (batch_size, 1)
        ↓
Sigmoid Activation → (batch_size, 1)
        ↓
Output: probability between 0 and 1
```

| Index | Layer   | Input Shape     | Output Shape    | Parameters               |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| [0]   | Linear  | (batch_size, 5) | (batch_size, 3) | weight: (3,5), bias: (3,)|
| [1]   | ReLU    | (batch_size, 3) | (batch_size, 3) | None                     |
| [2]   | Linear  | (batch_size, 3) | (batch_size, 1) | weight: (1,3), bias: (1,)|
| [3]   | Sigmoid | (batch_size, 1) | (batch_size, 1) | None                     |

## Key Concepts

**`nn.Sequential`**
A container that chains layers in order. Data flows through each layer automatically — cleaner than writing each step manually in `forward()`.

**`nn.ReLU`**
Activation function used in hidden layers. Returns `max(0, x)` — kills negative values, keeps positive ones. Used between layers to add non-linearity.

**`nn.Sigmoid`**
Used in the final output layer for binary classification. Squashes output to range (0, 1).

**Why ReLU in hidden layers, Sigmoid at output?**
```
Hidden layers → ReLU   (fast, avoids vanishing gradients)
Output layer  → Sigmoid (gives probability for binary classification)
```

## Accessing Weights by Index

Since `nn.Sequential` stores layers by index, access them like this:

```python
model.net[0].weight  # First Linear layer weights  → shape (3, 5)
model.net[0].bias    # First Linear layer bias     → shape (3,)
model.net[2].weight  # Second Linear layer weights → shape (1, 3)
model.net[2].bias    # Second Linear layer bias    → shape (1,)
```

Note: `net[1]` is ReLU and `net[3]` is Sigmoid — they have no weights.

## Difference from nnModule1

| | nnModule1 | nnModule2 |
|---|---|---|
| Layers | 1 Linear + Sigmoid | 2 Linear + ReLU + Sigmoid |
| Style | Explicit attributes | `nn.Sequential` |
| Weight access | `model.linear.weight` | `model.net[0].weight` |
| Hidden layer | None | ReLU |
| Use case | Simple binary | Deeper binary |

## How to Run

```python
import torch

# Create dummy data
data = torch.rand(100, 5)   # 100 samples, 5 features

# Create model
model = Model(data.shape[1])

# Forward pass
output = model(data)        # shape: (100, 1)

# Inspect weights
print(model.net[0].weight)  # shape: (3, 5)
print(model.net[2].weight)  # shape: (1, 3)
```

---

## Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchinfo
```
